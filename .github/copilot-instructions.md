# Project description

This project is a distributed monitoring system designed to track reachability and performance of agents installed on various hosts. It consists of a central server that collects data from multiple agents deployed across different machines. The system provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting capabilities to ensure the health and performance of the monitored infrastructure.

# Key Features
- **Agent-Based Monitoring**: Lightweight agents installed on hosts to collect metrics and send them to the central server.
- **Centralized Data Collection**: A server that aggregates data from all agents for analysis and reporting.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Configurable alerts based on predefined thresholds to notify administrators of potential issues.
- **Performance Metrics**: Collection of various performance metrics such as reachability, response time and potentially other system metrics that can be extended via plugins.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of agents and hosts efficiently.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Support for plugins to extend monitoring capabilities and integrate with other systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web-based dashboard for visualizing data, configuring agents, and managing alerts.
- **APIs for Integration**: RESTful APIs to allow integration with other systems and automation tools.

# Technologies Used
- Agent Development is in Rust for performance and safety.
- Server-side components are developed in Go.
- Data storage using a time-series database (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB) for efficient metric storage and retrieval.
- Web interface built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, TypeScript) for a responsive user experience CSS framework (e.g. Bulima).
- Communication between agents and server using RESTful APIs over HTTP/HTTPS.
- Containerization using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- Orchestration using Kubernetes for managing deployments in a clustered environment.
- Monitoring and logging using Prometheus and Grafana for system health and performance visualization.
- Database is PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data handling.
- Database scheme stored and managed using github repo with migrations handled by a tool like Flyway or Liquibase.

# Agent Capabilities
- Agents check reachability of other agents or predefined endpoints.
- Measure response times and log results.
- Send collected data to the central server at regular intervals.
- Support for custom plugins to extend monitoring functionality.
- Configuration management to adjust monitoring parameters remotely from the server. Must be able use local configuration if server is unreachable.
- Secure communication with the server using TLS/SSL.

Agent should be able to operate in a standalone mode if the server is unreachable, caching data locally and sending it once the connection is restored. Agents should also support auto-updates to ensure they are running the latest version. Agent use ICMP ping and traceroute for reachability checks, with options for TCP/UDP checks as plugins. 

Agent implementation should prioritize low resource usage to minimize impact on host performance. Therefore tokio async runtime is preferred for Rust implementation. 

# Server Capabilities
- Receive and store data from multiple agents.
- Provide a web-based dashboard for data visualization and management.
- Configure agents remotely, including setting monitoring intervals and thresholds.
- Generate reports based on collected data.
- Send alerts to Discord, email, or other notification systems when thresholds are breached.
- Provide RESTful APIs for data access and integration with other systems.
- Support user authentication and role-based access control for secure management.
- Implement data retention policies to manage storage usage effectively.
- Support for horizontal scaling to handle increased load as the number of agents grows.
- Server endpoints must be generated using OpenAPI/Swagger for easy integration and documentation.

# Endpoints
- RESTful API endpoints for agent data submission, configuration management, and data retrieval.
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time data updates to the dashboard.
- Authentication endpoints for user login and management.
- /metrics endpoint for Prometheus monitoring.
- /healthz endpoint for server status monitoring.
- API versioning implementet via URL path (e.g., /api/v1/).

# Deployment
- Use Docker for containerization of the server components.
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and management of server deployments.
- Provide Helm charts for easy deployment in Kubernetes environments.
- Include CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of both agents and server components.
- Provide documentation for installation, configuration, and usage of the system.

# Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting.
- API documentation generated using OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Guides for developing custom plugins for agents.
- Best practices for deploying and scaling the system in production environments.

# Community and Support
- Encourage community contributions through GitHub.
- Provide support channels such as a discussion forum or Discord server for users to seek help and share knowledge.
- Regular updates and maintenance to ensure the system remains secure and up-to-date with the latest technologies
- Roadmap for future features and improvements based on user feedback and industry trends.

# Licensing
- Source available prohibiting SaaS usage without a commercial license.
- Use a permissive open-source license for non-SaaS usage (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
- Clearly define terms for commercial usage and contributions.
- Include a CONTRIBUTING.md file to guide contributors on how to participate in the project.
